/**
 * Data Catalog Project Starter Code - SEA Stage 2
 *
 * This file is where you should be doing most of your work. You should
 * also make changes to the HTML and CSS files, but we want you to prioritize
 * demonstrating your understanding of data structures, and you'll do that
 * with the JavaScript code you write in this file.
 *
 * The comments in this file are only to help you learn how the starter code
 * works. The instructions for the project are in the README. That said, here
 * are the three things you should do first to learn about the starter code:
 * - 1 - Change something small in index.html or style.css, then reload your
 *    browser and make sure you can see that change.
 * - 2 - On your browser, right click anywhere on the page and select
 *    "Inspect" to open the browser developer tools. Then, go to the "console"
 *    tab in the new window that opened up. This console is where you will see
 *    JavaScript errors and logs, which is extremely helpful for debugging.
 *    (These instructions assume you're using Chrome, opening developer tools
 *    may be different on other browsers. We suggest using Chrome.)
 * - 3 - Add another string to the titles array a few lines down. Reload your
 *    browser and observe what happens. You should see a fourth "card" appear
 *    with the string you added to the array, but a broken image.
 *

// Your final submission should have much more data than this, and
// you should use more than just an array of strings to store it all.

// This function adds cards the page to display the data in the array
function showCards() {
  const cardContainer = document.getElementById("card-container");
  cardContainer.innerHTML = "";
  const templateCard = document.querySelector(".card");

  for (let i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) {
    const cardData = cards[i];
    const nextCard = templateCard.cloneNode(true); 
    editCardContent(nextCard, cardData);
    cardContainer.appendChild(nextCard); 
  }
}

function editCardContent(card, data) {
  card.style.display = "block";
  const cardImage = card.querySelector("img");
  cardImage.src = data.image;
  cardImage.alt = data.name;

  console.log("new card:", data.name);
}

// This calls the addCards() function when the page is first loaded
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", showCards);

const button = document.getElementById("to-top-button");
button.addEventListener("click", () => {
    window.scrollTo({
      top: 0,
      behavior: "smooth"
    });
  });

function quoteAlert() {
  console.log("Button Clicked!");
  alert(
    "I guess I can kiss heaven goodbye, because it got to be a sin to look this good!",
  );
}

function removeLastCard() {
  cards.pop(); // Remove last item in titles array
  showCards(); // Call showCards again to refresh
}
